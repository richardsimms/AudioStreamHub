The Unexpected field error suggests that your server is receiving a field in the request body that it is not configured to handle. This typically occurs when the payload structure from Mailgun does not match what your server expects.

Likely Issues:
Server is Not Handling multipart/form-data Properly:
Mailgun sends email data as multipart/form-data, which requires specific handling on the server side.
Mismatch Between Expected and Actual Payload:
Your server may not be configured to handle all fields sent by Mailgun in the webhook payload.
Steps to Resolve:
1. Update Server to Handle multipart/form-data

Ensure your server uses middleware to parse multipart/form-data. For Express.js, use the multer middleware:

const express = require('express');
const multer = require('multer');
const upload = multer(); // Initialize multer for multipart/form-data parsing

const app = express();

app.post('/api/email/incoming', upload.none(), (req, res) => {
    try {
        console.log('Received email webhook:', req.body);
        // Process email data here
        res.status(200).json({ message: 'Email received and processed' });
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error processing email:', error);
        res.status(500).json({ body: { message: error.message } });
    }
});

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`));
2. Check Mailgun Webhook Payload

Mailgun sends several fields in the payload, such as:

recipient
sender
from
subject
body-plain
stripped-text
attachments
Ensure your endpoint is equipped to handle these fields. Log the incoming req.body to confirm the fields being sent:

app.post('/api/email/incoming', upload.none(), (req, res) => {
    console.log('Incoming webhook payload:', req.body);
    res.status(200).json({ message: 'Logged payload' });
});
